# Preparation for the Murex Dev Interview 

Your journey as Software Developer at Murex starts here! 

# Our Hiring Process 

The Murex Hiring process for any “Development” role consists of the following steps:

## 1. Prepare for Your Recruitment Process

We highly encourage you to go through the resources and materials shared in the "_**Getting Yourself Ready**_" section before you apply to Murex.

These resources will help you prepare for the different technical topics that you will be assessed on when sitting for our technical test and when meeting with our experts.

## 2. Online Application

The recruitment process at Murex starts by submitting an Online Application for the position you are applying for on our career portal.

It is a very simple and clear process that starts by creating your candidate profile and submitting an updated CV for the position you are applying for.

It is important to note that your application will be reviewed within a period of 1 week from the date you submit your CV.

Having said that, make sure that you are well prepared before being contacted by the recruitment team.

## 3. CV Screening

After submitting your online application and updated resume, your CV will be thoroughly reviewed by the recruitment team to ensure that your profile (educational background and experience) matches with the job requirements for which you have applied.

Below are some pieces of advice we would like you to consider while updating your CV:

Ensure that your CV is concise, and still reflects all information that might be valuable and relevant for the role you are applying for
Make sure it is aligned with the opportunity you are applying for
List the projects you have worked on during your studies, end of year project, internships, or professional experience

## 4. Technical Test

A link will be shared with you to conduct our online technical test.

The Talent Acquisition team will coordinate with you to agree on a specific date for the test (usually within 2 weeks after being contacted).

In case you went through the training material and feel ready, the online test will be scheduled within a couple of days.

Make sure that you read the "_**Getting Yourself Ready**_" section before this step.

## 5. HR Interview

The interview with the recruitment team is always planned for 60 minutes. During this hour, the team will ask you questions to assess some behavioral skills that fit with the job you applied for and with the company's values.

To prepare for this part of the process, we encourage you to:

1. Research the company well and understand what we do
2. Get ready to share examples that demonstrate your communication skills, teamwork capabilities, and other behavioral competencies that are important for the role
3. Be yourself in the meeting, clear and specific when sharing your examples and past experiences

## 6. Technical Interview

Once you go through the HR interview, you will be invited for a technical one for a duration of two hours.

You will be meeting with two experts from the DEV department. Your interviewers would like to know more about your technical skills. They will ask you some technical questions to better assess your coding skills and knowledge and better understand your reasoning thinking. Being able to show your reasoning skills is as important as giving the right answer!

Make sure that you read the "_**Getting Yourself Ready**_" section before this step.

## 7. Matching Interview

This would be the last step of our recruitment process before you reach the offer stage.

A meeting will be scheduled with a potential hiring team that is looking for a newcomer with your skill set to join them.

Feel free to ask all relevant questions related to the role and job requirements.

# Getting Yourself Ready

To help you prepare for your Technical Test and Interview, we created an outline of learning material for you to explore.

We grouped the learning material for both Java and C++ into four knowledge domains (Language Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Algorithms).

## What to Prepare

The technical test will require knowledge of the 4 domains (Language Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Algorithms).  However, it is possible to skip the advanced coding problem in the technical test in any one of the two domains: Object-Oriented Programming and Algorithms.

After an internal evaluation, you will be selected for either an OOP or an Algorithm based technical interview.

The OOP-based interview will include questions from the following knowledge domains: 
1. Language Basics
2. Data Structures
3. Object-Oriented Programming

On the other hand, an Algorithm based interview will consist of questions from the following knowledge domains: 
1. Language Basics
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms

Based on that, we advise you to focus on the sections corresponding to your interview type.

This is how to best use these resources to your advantage during the Technical Test and the Technical Interview, so please take the time to follow the below steps before applying:

1. Select a programming language (C++ or Java) that you want to use for your technical evaluations
2. Navigate to the outline of the required material corresponding to the programming language that you selected
3. Make sure to study all the topics in the outline from resources that you can find (websites, books, etc...)
4. Some websites are provided for you where you can start looking for this material
5. Make sure to practice as much as possible by reviewing the theoretical concepts and also by solving coding exercises
6. Once you are done with the above and once you are satisfied that you can solve coding questions at a good pace, then you can apply to sit for the technical test and the technical interview
