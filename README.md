# Getting Yourself Ready

To help you prepare for your Technical Test and Interview, we created an outline of learning material for you to explore.

We grouped the learning material for both Java and C++ into four knowledge domains (Language Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Algorithms).

## What to Prepare
Based on your choice and preference, you will be selected for either an OOP or an Algorithm based technical interview.

The OOP-based interview will include questions from the following knowledge domains: 
1. Language Basics
2. Data Structures
3. Object-Oriented Programming

On the other hand, an Algorithm based interview will consist of questions from the following knowledge domains: 
1. Language Basics
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms

Based on that, we advise you to focus on the sections corresponding to your interview type.
