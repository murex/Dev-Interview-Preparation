Click apply and start your hiring process by creating your candidate profile and submitting an updated CV.

Once your application has been submitted, it will be reviewed by our team within 1 week.

So make sure you're well prepared before the Talent Acquisition team contacts you.

## 3. Application Screening

After submitting your online application, the Talent Acquisition team will thoroughly review it to ensure that your profile (educational background and experience) matches the job requirements you have applied to.

Below are a few tips to help you update your CV:

1. Ensure your CV is concise, and still reflects all information that might be valuable and relevant for the role you are applying for
2. Make sure it's aligned with the opportunity you are applying for
3. List the projects you have worked on during your studies, final year project, internships, or professional experience

## 4. Technical Test

Once your application is screened, the Talent Acquisition team will contact you to schedule a specific date for the online technical test.

The test can be scheduled between two days and two weeks after the call.  A link to the test will be shared via email.  

Before you start your test, make sure that you read the "_**Getting Yourself Ready**_" section.

## 5. HR Interview

Next, you will be invited for a one-hour interview with the Talent Acquisition team.  

This is our chance to get to know you better and assess your qualifications for the role.

To prepare for this part of the process, we encourage you to:

1. Research the company well and understand what we do
2. Get ready to share examples that demonstrate your communication skills, teamwork capabilities, and other soft skills relative to the role
3. Be yourself in the meeting, clear and specific when sharing your examples and past experiences

## 6. Technical Interview

Once you go through the HR interview, you will be invited for a two-hour technical interview.

You will meet with two experts from the DEV department to learn more about your technical skills. They will ask you some technical questions to better assess your coding skills and knowledge and better understand your reasoning thinking. Being able to show your reasoning skills is as important as giving the right answer!

Make sure that you read the "_**Getting Yourself Ready**_" section before this step.

## 7. Matching Interview

This is the last step in our hiring process before you reach the offer stage.

A meeting will be scheduled with a potential team looking for someone with your skills to join them.

Feel free to ask all relevant questions related to the role and job requirements.

# Getting Yourself Ready

To help you prepare for your Technical Test and Interview, we created an outline of learning material for you to explore.

We grouped the learning material for both Java and C++ into four knowledge domains (Language Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Algorithms).

## What to Prepare

### Hackerrank Technical Test


The technical test requires knowledge of the 4 domains (Language Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming,
and Algorithms). While the following may not be a necessity to pass the test, it is recommended to try to attempt to solve all the questions in the test to show your skills in all knowledge domains.

To secure higher chances of success, we advise you first to tackle the questions corresponding to your preferred programming domain.

### Live Technical Interview 

After an internal evaluation of your test result, you will be selected for either an OOP or an Algorithm based technical interview.

The OOP-based interview will include questions from the following knowledge domains: 
1. Language Basics
2. Data Structures
3. Object-Oriented Programming

On the other hand, the Algorithm based interview will consist of questions from the following knowledge domains: 
1. Language Basics
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms

### Resources 

These resources are a great way to prepare for the technical test and the technical interview.

We highly recommend taking the time to review them before applying.

Here are a few steps to help before you start:

1. Select a programming language (C++ or Java) that you want to use for your technical evaluations
2. Navigate to the outline of the required material corresponding to the programming language you selected
3. Study all the topics in the outline from resources you can find (websites, books, etc...)
4. Some websites are provided for you where you can start looking for this material. Practice as much as possible by reviewing the theoretical concepts and solving coding exercises.
5. Once done with the above and satisfied that you can solve coding questions at a good pace, you can apply to sit for the technical test and the technical interview.
